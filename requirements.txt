# Core NLP and Speech
transformers[torch] # For Hugging Face models, including Whisper, T5, BART, GPT-2
# Using [torch] to ensure PyTorch is pulled if not explicitly listed
# torch # Explicitly listing torch can also be good

# Speech specific
# soundfile # Often needed by transformers for audio loading
# librosa # Another powerful audio library, transformers might use it or soundfile
# datasets # For loading sample audio in test, and potentially for other data handling

# OpenVINO
openvino>=2023.2.0
openvino-dev>=2023.2.0 # For model conversion tools

# UI (Phase 3)
gradio
# streamlit

# Other utilities
numpy
# pandas # Might be useful for feedback report

# Previous project's (multimodal assistant) dependencies - can be pruned if not needed by new plan
# opencv-python
# SpeechRecognition # For microphone input, not prioritized in new plan's phase 1
# pyttsx3
# pytesseract
# Pillow
# fer
# matplotlib

# Ensure specific versions if known issues arise, e.g.:
# protobuf < 3.20.0 # If compatibility issues with older ONNX/OpenVINO arise
# sacremoses # Often a sub-dependency for tokenizers in summarization models
# sentencepiece # Tokenizer for T5 and other models
