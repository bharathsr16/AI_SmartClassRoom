#         # results = ov_compiled_model([input_data_dict[ov_input_layer_name]]) # If only one input and it's a list

#         # The `results` object is a dictionary where keys are output layer names.
#         # We need to know the name of the output layer that contains the generated token IDs.
#         # Let's assume `ov_output_layer_name` correctly refers to this.

#         # For a real seq2seq model, generation is iterative, or the ONNX/OpenVINO model
#         # must encapsulate the full generation loop (e.g. using beam search op).
#         # A simple forward pass usually just gives logits, not the final summarized text.
#         # If the OpenVINO model is just the encoder-decoder stack without the generation logic,
#         # then one would have to implement the autoregressive decoding loop manually.

#         # Simulating output for now, as true generation is complex to set up generically here.
#         print("  (OpenVINO actual inference step would be here - complex for seq2seq generation)")
#         # For demonstration, let's assume output_ids is something plausible if inference worked.
#         # This would normally come from `results[<output_name_for_ids>]`
#         # Example: output_ids = np.array([[ov_tokenizer.pad_token_id, ov_tokenizer.eos_token_id, 101, 102, 103, ov_tokenizer.eos_token_id]])
